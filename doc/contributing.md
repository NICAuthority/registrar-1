# Contributing

### Overview

* Fork woodnsword-registrar.
* Use gofmt!
* Make one commit for every atomic change you make. Do not try to sneak
  in extra changes.
* Ensure that your commit message's summary line is an imperative
  sentence with no ending punctuation.
* Write an thoroughly descriptive commit message for your changes,
  unless absolutely unnecessary (such as when removing accidental extra
  spaces). Wrap your message's subject line to 50 columns, and its body
  lines to 72 columns.
* Make a pull request to the appropriate upstream branch. Include a
  thorough description of your changes.
* Wait for one of the reviewers to look at your PR and either merge it
  or give feedback which you should adapt to.
