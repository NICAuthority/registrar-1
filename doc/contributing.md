# Contributing

### Overview

* Fork woodnsword-registrar
* Make one commit for every change you make. Do not try to sneak in
  extra changes.
* Write an exceedingly descriptive commit message for your changes,
  unless absolutely unnecessary (such as when removing accidental extra
  spaces, but even a typo should include a link to proof of correct
  spelling). Wrap your message's subject line to 50 columns, and its
  body lines to 72 columns.
* Make a pull request with your changes directly to master. Include a
  description of your changes.
* Wait for one of the reviewers to look at your code and either merge it
  or give feedback which you should adapt to.
